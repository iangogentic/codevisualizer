# Decision Tree: Build vs Fork Code Visualization Tool

## Quick Decision Framework

```
START: Do you need a code visualization tool?
│
├─► YES → Continue
│
└─► Question 1: Do you need it FAST (< 3 months)?
    │
    ├─► NO → Build from scratch is viable
    │        (but still not recommended)
    │
    └─► YES → Question 2: Is there an open source project 
                          that covers 50%+ of your needs?
        │
        ├─► NO → Hybrid approach (use libraries)
        │        Time: 12-16 weeks
        │
        └─► YES → Question 3: Is the codebase maintained 
                              and extensible?
            │
            ├─► NO → Look for alternatives
            │
            └─► YES → ✅ FORK IT!
                      └─► Emerge = BEST MATCH
                          Time: 6-10 weeks
```

## Technology Debt Analysis

### If You Build from Scratch:
You'll need to implement (or integrate):
1. **Multi-language parser** → Use tree-sitter (2 weeks to integrate)
2. **Dependency analyzer** → Build algorithm (3-4 weeks)
3. **Graph data structure** → Use NetworkX (1 week)
4. **GitHub API client** → Use PyGithub (1 week)
5. **Code metrics** → Build or integrate (2-3 weeks)
6. **Duplicate detector** → Use jscpd (1 week)
7. **Dead code detector** → Build algorithm (3-4 weeks)
8. **Web frontend** → React + React Flow (4-6 weeks)
9. **Backend API** → FastAPI/Express (2-3 weeks)
10. **Auth system** → OAuth (1-2 weeks)
11. **Database** → Setup + schema (1 week)
12. **Deployment** → Docker, CI/CD (1-2 weeks)

**Total: 22-32 weeks of work**

### If You Fork Emerge:
You'll need to add:
1. **GitHub integration** → 1-2 weeks
2. **Web UI** → 3-4 weeks (React + React Flow)
3. **Dead code detector** → 2-3 weeks
4. **Duplicate integration** → 1 week (jscpd)
5. **Health indicators** → 1-2 weeks
6. **Deployment** → 1 week

**Total: 9-13 weeks of work** (but we estimated 10 weeks conservatively)

**Savings: 13-19 weeks = ~65% less work**

## Decision Factors by Priority

### If SPEED is your #1 priority:
→ **Fork Emerge** (6-10 weeks to production)
→ Can have demo in 4 weeks

### If FEATURES are your #1 priority:
→ **Fork CodeCharta** (best existing features)
→ But longer dev time (8-12 weeks)

### If LEARNING is your #1 priority:
→ **Build from Scratch** (full control, understanding)
→ But 6+ months

### If COST is your #1 priority:
→ **Fork Emerge** (lowest total cost: ~$30k)
→ Best ROI

### If FLEXIBILITY is your #1 priority:
→ **Hybrid Approach** (use libraries, custom architecture)
→ Middle ground (12-16 weeks)

### If VISUAL QUALITY is your #1 priority:
→ **Fork CodeCharta** (impressive 3D visualization)
→ Can make it even better

## Real-World Comparison

### Similar Projects That Forked vs Built:

#### Success Stories (Forked):
- **Sourcegraph** - Built on existing code intelligence tools
- **GitKraken** - Extended Git visualization libraries
- **Prettier** - Forked from earlier code formatters

#### Struggles (Built from Scratch):
- Many abandoned code viz projects on GitHub
- High complexity → Never finished
- Reinvented solved problems

## The "Regret Matrix"

### If you BUILD FROM SCRATCH and it fails:
- Lost: 6-12 months + $120k+
- Regret: "We should have used existing tools"
- Recovery: Start over with fork

### If you FORK and it doesn't work:
- Lost: 2-4 weeks (evaluation phase)
- Regret: "We should have tried another base"
- Recovery: Switch to different base or hybrid approach

**Risk Asymmetry: Forking has MUCH less downside risk**

## Action Plan: Next 48 Hours

### Step 1: Validate Emerge (4 hours)
```bash
# Clone Emerge
git clone https://github.com/glato/emerge.git
cd emerge

# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test on a sample repo
python emerge.py --help
```

**Evaluate:**
- [ ] Does it run successfully?
- [ ] Is the code readable?
- [ ] Does the output make sense?
- [ ] Can you see how to extend it?

### Step 2: Prototype Visualization (4 hours)
```bash
# Create quick React app
npx create-react-app code-viz
cd code-viz
npm install reactflow

# Try visualizing Emerge's output
# (parse JSON, render in React Flow)
```

**Evaluate:**
- [ ] Is React Flow suitable?
- [ ] Can you parse Emerge's output?
- [ ] Is performance acceptable?
- [ ] Does the visualization look good?

### Step 3: Make Decision (1 hour)
Based on above:
- ✅ If both work well → **Proceed with Emerge fork**
- ⚠️ If Emerge doesn't fit → **Try CodeCharta**
- ❌ If nothing fits → **Reconsider requirements**

## Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **How much time do I realistically have?**
   - < 3 months → Fork
   - 3-6 months → Fork or Hybrid
   - 6+ months → Any approach

2. **What's my skill level?**
   - Beginner → Fork (easier)
   - Intermediate → Fork or Hybrid
   - Expert → Any approach

3. **Do I want to contribute to open source?**
   - Yes → Fork (can PR improvements back)
   - No → Fork or Build (your choice)

4. **Is this a product or a learning project?**
   - Product → Fork (faster to market)
   - Learning → Build (more educational)

5. **Do I have a team or solo?**
   - Solo → Fork (less overwhelming)
   - Team → Any approach (can divide work)

## The Bottom Line

### If you asked me to bet my money:
**I would fork Emerge and add a React frontend.**

**Why?**
- Fastest path to a working product
- Lowest financial risk
- Proven technology foundation
- Can always refactor later if needed
- You'll learn by extending, not just building

**The goal is to create value for users, not to build everything yourself.**
