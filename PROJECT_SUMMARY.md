3. **Week 2:** Begin development
4. **Week 10:** Launch MVP

## üéì Lessons from Research

### What We Learned

#### 1. Don't Reinvent the Wheel
Many developers tried building code visualizers from scratch. Most projects are abandoned. Successful tools built on existing foundations.

#### 2. Visualization Is Easier Than Analysis
React Flow makes beautiful graphs easy. But parsing code, building dependency graphs, and detecting issues is hard. Use Emerge for the hard part.

#### 3. Time-to-Market Matters
10 weeks with Emerge vs 6 months from scratch = **4x faster iteration cycle**. In competitive markets, speed wins.

#### 4. Dead Code Detection Is Complex
Simple static analysis has high false positive rates. Need sophisticated call graph analysis with heuristics to reduce false positives.

#### 5. User Feedback Is Critical
Build MVP fast, get real user feedback, iterate. Don't spend 6 months building features nobody wants.

---

## üí° Best Practices

### During Development

#### 1. Start with Validation
- Weekend test (8 hours) saves months of work
- Validate Emerge integration before committing
- Test React Flow with real data early

#### 2. Build Iteratively
- Working software > perfect code
- Ship weekly prototypes
- Get feedback early and often

#### 3. Focus on Core Value
- GitHub integration
- Health indicators
- Dead code detection
These are YOUR differentiators. Perfect these first.

#### 4. Monitor Performance
- Test with large repos early (Week 3)
- Set performance budgets (30s analysis, 60 FPS)
- Don't wait until Week 9 to discover performance issues

#### 5. Document as You Go
- Code comments for complex logic
- API documentation
- Architecture decisions
- Don't defer documentation to the end

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Why fork Emerge instead of building from scratch?
**A:** 60-80% time savings, $90k cost savings, lower risk. Emerge solves the hard problems (code parsing, dependency analysis). We focus on unique features (visualization, health indicators).

### Q: What if Emerge doesn't work out?
**A:** We validate in Week 0 (weekend tests). If it fails, we pivot to CodeCharta or hybrid approach. Only 8 hours lost.

### Q: Can we really build this in 10 weeks?
**A:** Yes, because we're not building everything. Emerge = foundation (60-70% of work). We add 30-40% (UI, GitHub integration, dead code detection).

### Q: What about scaling?
**A:** MVP targets small-medium repos (<10k files). Post-MVP, we add clustering, progressive loading, better caching for large repos.

### Q: Is Python fast enough?
**A:** Yes. Emerge already handles large codebases. FastAPI is very fast. Analysis runs async (doesn't block). Caching reduces repeated analysis.

### Q: Why not use AI for everything?
**A:** AI is great for insights (future feature), but expensive and unpredictable. Static analysis is fast, cheap, and deterministic. MVP uses static analysis; v2.0 adds AI.

### Q: What's the monetization strategy?
**A:** MVP is free (build user base). Future options: premium features, enterprise offering, GitHub integration marketplace. Decide after validating product-market fit.
