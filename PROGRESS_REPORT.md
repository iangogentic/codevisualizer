## 🚧 Known Issues / TODOs

### Immediate:
- [ ] TASK-205: Set up Celery (needed for async analysis)
- [ ] Test API endpoints manually
- [ ] Run backend with Docker

### Short-term:
- [ ] Add more tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement actual analysis execution
- [ ] Parse GraphML for dependency edges

### Long-term:
- [ ] Dead code detection algorithm
- [ ] Duplicate code integration
- [ ] Advanced UI features

## 📸 What You Can See

**In Browser (localhost:3000):**
- Interactive code map
- 24 Flask files visualized
- Color-coded health:
  - app.py: 🔴 RED (1144 LOC, 24 methods - complex!)
  - config.py: 🟢 GREEN (282 LOC, 7 methods - healthy!)
  - cli.py: 🟡 YELLOW (825 LOC, 24 methods - warning!)

**Click any node** → See full metrics (file path, LOC, methods, health)

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### **Continue Now?**
- ✅ We're on a roll!
- ✅ Next tasks are clear (Celery, analysis engine)
- ✅ Can have full analysis working in 1-2 hours

### **Or Stop Here?**
- ✅ Solid foundation complete
- ✅ Working prototype deployed
- ✅ Can resume anytime with "continue from TASK-205"
