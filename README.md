cd emerge
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m emerge --help
```

Test it on a sample repository and verify it works.

## 💡 Key Insights from Research

### Insight #1: Don't Reinvent the Wheel
Parsing code, building dependency graphs, and multi-language support are **solved problems**. Use existing tools.

### Insight #2: Focus on Your Unique Value
Your differentiation is:
- GitHub integration
- Interactive visualization
- Health indicators
- Dead code detection

Build THESE, not the foundation.

### Insight #3: Time to Market Matters
6 weeks with Emerge vs 6 months from scratch = **You can iterate 4x faster**

### Insight #4: Risk Asymmetry
- Fork fails after 2 weeks → Pivot to another base
- Build from scratch fails after 6 months → Massive loss

**Forking has much less downside risk.**

2. **Am I comfortable with Python and React?**
   - Yes → Perfect fit
   - No → Budget time for learning

3. **Is this a product or learning project?**
   - Product → Fork (fastest)
   - Learning → Can build from scratch if desired

4. **Do I have budget for $30k+ in development?**
