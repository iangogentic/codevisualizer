# Cursor AI Agent Rules for CodeMapper Project
# Version: 1.0
# Last Updated: September 30, 2025

## 🎯 PROJECT CONTEXT

You are working on **CodeMapper**, a code visualization and analysis platform.

**Core Documents:**
- `PRD.md` - Complete product specification (2,138 lines)
- `TASKS.md` - Task breakdown with status tracking
- `RESEARCH_ANALYSIS.md` - Technical research and decisions
- `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` - Implementation guide

**Technical Approach:**
- Forking Emerge (https://github.com/glato/emerge) as foundation
- Building React + TypeScript frontend with React Flow
- 10-week MVP timeline
- Python (FastAPI) backend + PostgreSQL + Redis

## 🔄 MANDATORY WORKFLOW - READ THIS FIRST

### BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE:

1. **CHECK TASK LIST**
   ```
   - Read TASKS.md
   - Find current task or next task to work on
   - Check task status and dependencies
   - Verify acceptance criteria
   ```

2. **CHECK PRD FOR SPECIFICATIONS**
   ```
   - Read relevant section in PRD.md
   - Understand requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Check API contracts, schemas, algorithms
   - Verify design specifications
   ```

3. **UNDERSTAND CONTEXT**
   ```
   - What phase are we in? (Setup, Development, Testing, Launch)
   - What was completed previously?
   - What's the immediate next step?
   - Are there any blockers?
   ```

---

## 📋 TASK MANAGEMENT RULES

### When Starting Work:

1. **Identify Current Task**
   - Look in TASKS.md for tasks with status: ⬜ TODO or 🔄 IN PROGRESS
   - Respect dependencies (don't start TASK-202 if TASK-201 isn't done)
   - Follow the critical path when possible

2. **Update Task Status**
   - Change status from ⬜ TODO to 🔄 IN PROGRESS
   - Update assignee if needed
   - Add start date

3. **Reference PRD**
   - Read the PRD section referenced in the task
   - Understand acceptance criteria
   - Check for related specifications (API contracts, algorithms, UI specs)

### While Working:

1. **Check Off Subtasks**
   - As you complete each subtask, check it off in TASKS.md
   - Update inline: `- [ ]` becomes `- [x]`

2. **Follow Specifications**
   - Implement exactly as specified in PRD
   - Use exact API contracts from PRD.md p.44-46
   - Follow design system from PRD.md p.54-55
   - Use database schema from PRD.md p.42

3. **Write Tests**
   - Every code change needs corresponding tests
   - Aim for >80% coverage
   - Tests must pass before marking task complete

### After Completing Work:

1. **Update Task Status**
   ```markdown
   **Status:** ✅ DONE
   **Completed:** [Date]
   **Notes:** [Any important notes]
   ```

2. **Check Off All Subtasks**
   - Ensure all `- [ ]` are changed to `- [x]`

3. **Update TASKS.md**
   - Mark task as complete
   - Add completion date
   - Document any deviations from plan
   - Note any new issues discovered

4. **Verify Acceptance Criteria**
   - Go through each acceptance criterion
   - Confirm all are met
   - Document if any are partially met

5. **Identify Next Task**
   - Look at dependencies
   - Suggest which task to work on next
   - Check if any tasks are now unblocked

---

## 📖 DOCUMENT REFERENCE PRIORITY

When user asks to implement a feature:

1. **FIRST:** Check TASKS.md - Is there a task for this?
2. **SECOND:** Check PRD.md - What are the specifications?
3. **THIRD:** Check RESEARCH_ANALYSIS.md - What technology decisions were made?
4. **FOURTH:** Check QUICK_START_GUIDE.md - Are there code examples?

---

## 🎨 CODING STANDARDS

### General Rules:

1. **Follow PRD Specifications Exactly**
   - API contracts from PRD.md p.44-46
   - Database schema from PRD.md p.42
   - Algorithm specifications (e.g., dead code detection PRD.md p.47)
   - Design system colors and typography PRD.md p.54-55

2. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript for frontend (strict mode)
   - Python type hints for backend
   - Define interfaces/types before implementation

3. **Error Handling**
   - All API calls must have try/catch
   - User-facing errors must be actionable (PRD.md p.56)
   - Log errors with context
   - Never expose internal errors to users

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for all functions
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - E2E tests for critical user flows
   - >80% code coverage

5. **Documentation**
   - JSDoc/docstrings for all public functions
   - Explain complex logic inline
   - Update DEVELOPMENT.md with any setup changes

### Code Style:

**Backend (Python):**
```python
# Use type hints
def calculate_health(file: dict) -> str:
    """
    Calculate health score for a file.
    
    Args:
        file: File metadata dict with complexity, duplicates, etc.
        
    Returns:
        Health status: 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'
        
    PRD Reference: PRD.md p.47
    """
    score = 100
    # Implementation per PRD specification...
```

**Frontend (TypeScript):**
```typescript
// Use interfaces
interface AnalysisResponse {
  id: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  github_url: string;
  // ... (PRD.md p.45)
}

// Use functional components with hooks
const CodeGraph: React.FC<Props> = ({ analysisId }) => {
  // Implementation...
};
```

## 🚨 ERROR HANDLING

**If you encounter:**

1. **Missing Specification in PRD**
   - Note the gap
   - Suggest specification based on requirements
   - Ask for approval before implementing

2. **Task Dependency Not Met**
   - Mark task as ⏸️ BLOCKED
   - Note which dependency is missing
   - Suggest alternative task to work on

3. **Timeline Concern**
   - Flag early if task taking longer than estimated
   - Suggest adjustments
   - Update TASKS.md with revised estimate

4. **Technical Blocker**
   - Document issue in TASKS.md
   - Research alternatives
   - Propose solutions

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You're following these rules correctly when:**

1. Every response checks TASKS.md first
2. Every implementation references PRD specifications
3. Every task completion updates TASKS.md
4. All code has tests
5. All acceptance criteria are verified
6. Progress is documented
7. Next tasks are identified

---

## 📝 REMEMBER

**The Golden Rule:**
> "If it's not in the PRD, don't implement it. If you're not sure which task you're on, check TASKS.md. After completing work, update TASKS.md."

**Priority Order:**
1. TASKS.md (What to work on)
2. PRD.md (How to implement it)
3. User request (Specific details)
4. Your judgment (Fill in reasonable gaps)

**Quality Standards:**
- PRD compliance > Speed
- Tests required > Optional
- Documentation required > Optional
- Acceptance criteria > Feature complete
